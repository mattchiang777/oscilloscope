# Oscilloscope Tool

Created with p5.js. Used to view the waveforms of different oscillator functions, modulate them, and experiment with parameters. 
Hopefully this serves as the foundation for future synthesizer and visual work.

## TODO:
* Add different types of nodes
* Find out how to create synthesizers
